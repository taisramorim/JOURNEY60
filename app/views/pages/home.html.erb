              <p>Hi all! I'm Karoline and I'm here because I have worked in the tech industry for a few years (in the customer success area, more specifically), and ever since I've wanted to learn more about programming. I have a bachelor's degree in International Relations and lived in Colombia for 3 years, which was where I had my first job in a tech company.</p>

              <h4>Stella Mascaro</h4>
              <p>I struggled to find my vocation as a teenager, and recently, I shifted my studies to something related to technology, which has always fascinated me. Last year, I started studying Computer Science, and I fell in love with it right away. However, I still felt like something was missing. Then, a colleague recommended Le Wagon, which was exactly what I was looking for in my programming journey. I'm really excited and looking forward to what seems like a life-changing experience!</p>

            <p>My unique journey began with over a decade of working on cruise ships, allowing me to travel the world and immerse myself in information technology (IT). This experience taught me the value of diversity and a mindset of continuous learning. I'm excited to apply my IT passion to future opportunities and collaborate with people from diverse backgrounds, believing that innovation arises from such diversity. I'm committed to making a meaningful contribution and continuing my journey of growth, both personally and professionally.</p>
